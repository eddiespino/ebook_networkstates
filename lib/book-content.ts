Introduction

This book (and accompanying audiobook) forms a go-to reference for understanding and achieving true decentralisation in social community blockchains and digital Network States. We believe in a model with:

- No Pre-Mines
- No ICO's (Initial Coin Offerings)
- No Companies or CEOs
- No Early Venture Capital

Instead, the community should guide the technology and governance, maintaining the neutrality of the base layer for itself, ensuring freedom and participation for everyone.

We will explore the game theory of network attacks, attack vectors, how to defend against attacks, guiding principles for decentralisation, a realistic vision for the future, and the best technical stacks for censorship resistance and governance.

Why Document This Now?

The community forming what has become the back bone of the Hive Blockchain has endured years of conflict, evolution, and successful defence against multiple takeover attempts yet it remains decentralised. The ability to remain decentralised over almost a decade at the time of publishing, means there is noteworthy knowledge to be gained and lessons to be learned from dissecting how Hive's community achieved this resilience.

Our ultimate aim is to document the "how and why" of proper and principled decentralisation, including the deeper implications for human freedom. In a world often controlled by entrenched power structures hostile to genuine decentralised, and therefore neutral systems, this knowledge is recorded immutably, and preserved under the account @networkstate on the Hive Blockchain.`,

Introduction

Decentralised technology extends far beyond the realm of digital payments; it gives communities the tools to form autonomous "Network States" online. As these groups gain genuine self-sovereignty, they can voluntarily exit failing systems and design their own economies and governance structures.

What is a Network State?

The Network-State is in contrast to the nation-state. Here we have a governance system that is based upon where one is geographically born. That is how citizenship is established. The rules of the land are based upon where one is physically. In comparison, the network-state is dependent upon which digital ecosystem or community one interacts and associates. This is paralleling the idea of nations and networks.

From the Definition in the book "The Network State" by Balaji Srinivasan:

"A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states."

Voluntary Migration to an Alternative, Parallel Economy

In the current centralised model, true power rests with large institutions governments, mega-corporations, and global financial conglomerates. These entities operate in a system which is set up to extract more from everyday people than it returns, leading to an erosion of personal freedom.

Decentralised economies offer a peaceful and genuinely empowering exit route. They allow people to:
- Own Digital Assets Outright
- Speak Freely
- Retain More Value`,

Introduction

Most blockchains claim to be decentralised, yet many have fallen short of delivering actual censorship resistance or meaningful digital rights. In this chapter, we explore the fundamental principles that support genuine decentralisation, why it is so hard to achieve, and how certain historical "freak events" accidentally resulted in the correct structural design.

Why True Decentralisation Is Difficult

Profit vs. Principles

Most project leaders focus on profit and convenience. They raise venture capital, pre ordain themselves tokens from the first day of the project in the form of large pre-mines or ICO's, or form legal entities. While these strategies may somewhat help to fund development, they inevitably compromise on decentralisation.

Censorship Resistance is Binary

Either your system can be controlled by external parties, or it cannot. If a chain has a headquarters, a known CEO, or a large pre-mined stake in the hands of a few insiders with self-ordained pre-mines or ICO stakes, there are clear points of failure. True censorship resistance requires that no single entity or small colluding group can seize control.

Counter-intuitive Choices

Many of the decisions that yield true decentralisation look bad on paper. For example, not raising money or not giving a founder a large token allocation seems "unprofitable." Yet these moves are necessary to avoid creating central points of attack.`,
